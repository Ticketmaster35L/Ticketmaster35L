# TicketMaster Bug Tracker React App
Welcome to the TicketMaster Bug Tracker React App! This is a simple bug tracking application built with Node.js and React and designed to help you keep track of bugs in your project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the TicketMaster Bug Tracker React App, you'll first need to clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ticketmaster35L/Ticketmaster35L.git
```
Once you've cloned the repository, you can install the dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:

```bash
npm install
```
After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the backend by running:

```bash
npm run server
```
This will start the backend server that deals with file manipulation and HTTP requests.
To view the frontend, you need to run:

```bash
npm start
```
This will start the development server and launch the application in your default browser at http://localhost:3000.
